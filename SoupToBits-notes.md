# Notes about [Soup to Bits: App Evolution With Swift](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-app-evolution-with-swift)

Some random notes I wrote while following along with the [Soup to Bits: App Evolution With Swift](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/soup-to-bits-app-evolution-with-swift) video. This extra work enhances the app built in the [App Evolution with Swift](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/app-evolution-with-swift) course. On completion of the video, the app has a tab bar, each product has a price and we have a working, persistent cart for our app. I intend to further enhance this app based on issues I log in the repo's [issue list](https://github.com/AndrewJByrne/GoodAsOldPhones-Swift/issues)

* Tab Bar Controller
* Relationship Segue
* Build and Run = CMD + R
* Using an alert controller to pop up a message to the user
* String Interpolation
* Nil-coalescing operator
* Adding a view for a header in cart
* Keyed Archiving

The video shows you how to add tab bar for the app containing three items each with a label and an icon. The icons used do not come with the original course work.  Instead, I grabbed the new icons for tab bar from  [GitHub](https://github.com/codeschool/AppEvolutionWithSwiftDemo/tree/master/Image%20Files)


Swift has a cool feature called string interpolation which allows you to use a variable directly inside another string. Syntax is `\(Your variable goes here)`
